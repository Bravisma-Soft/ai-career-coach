description: Stage all changes, commit with a message, and push to remote
---

Please help me commit and push my changes:

1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. Stage all changes with `git add -A`
3. Create a commit with the message I provide
4. Add the Claude Code attribution footer
5. Push to the current branch

Ask me for the commit message if I haven't provided one.
