# How to Test AI Features - Step by Step Guide

## ‚úÖ Status: Resume Parsing & Tailoring NOW CONNECTED!

Both features are now connected to the real backend and ready for testing.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites:

1. **Backend Environment Variables**:
```bash
# backend/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/ai_career_coach
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

2. **Frontend Environment Variables**:
```bash
# frontend/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

3. **Services Running**:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis server
- Backend API server
- Frontend dev server

---

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Start Services

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Redis
redis-server

# Terminal 2: Start Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
# Should see: Server running on http://localhost:5001

# Terminal 3: Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Should see: Local: http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 2: Verify Services

```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG

# Check Backend
curl http://localhost:5001/health
# Should return: {"success":true,"message":"AI Career Coach API is running"}

# Check Frontend
# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
# Should see login/register page
```

---

## üß™ Test Flow: Complete End-to-End

### Part 1: User Registration & Login

1. **Open Browser**: `http://localhost:5173`

2. **Register New Account**:
   - Click "Register" or "Sign Up"
   - Enter:
     - Email: `test@example.com`
     - Password: `Test123!@#`
     - First Name: `John`
     - Last Name: `Doe`
   - Click "Create Account"

3. **Verify Login**:
   - Should redirect to dashboard
   - Top right should show "John Doe" or "JD"

---

### Part 2: Upload & Parse Resume

#### Upload Resume:

1. **Navigate to Resumes Page**:
   - Click "Resumes" in sidebar/navigation
   - Should see resume list (empty initially)

2. **Upload a Resume**:
   - Click "Upload Resume" button
   - Select a PDF or DOCX file
     - Sample resumes: `backend/test/sample-resumes/` (if exists)
     - Or use any resume file you have
   - Enter title: "My Software Engineer Resume"
   - Click "Upload"

3. **Verify Upload**:
   - Should see new resume in list
   - Status: "Uploaded" or "Unparsed"

#### Parse Resume:

1. **Trigger Parsing**:
   - Find your uploaded resume
   - Click "Parse Resume" or similar button
   - Should see loading indicator

2. **Wait for Background Job** (5-30 seconds):
   - Backend processes resume in background queue
   - Can check backend logs for progress:
     ```
     Resume parsing requested: resume_xxx
     Resume parse job added to queue
     Processing resume parse job...
     Resume parsed successfully
     ```

3. **Verify Parsing Complete**:
   - Refresh page
   - Resume should now show "Parsed" status
   - Click on resume to view details
   - Should see extracted data:
     - ‚úÖ Personal Information (name, email, phone)
     - ‚úÖ Work Experience (companies, positions, dates)
     - ‚úÖ Education (degrees, institutions)
     - ‚úÖ Skills (list of skills)
     - ‚úÖ Certifications (if any)

#### Troubleshooting Resume Parsing:

**Issue**: Resume not parsing?
```bash
# Check Redis connection
redis-cli ping

# Check backend logs
cd backend && npm run dev
# Look for "Resume parse job added to queue"

# Check BullMQ queue
redis-cli
> KEYS *bull*
> LLEN bull:resume-parse:wait
```

**Issue**: Parsing takes too long?
- Check Claude API key is configured
- Check API quota isn't exceeded
- Try with a simpler resume (1-2 pages)

---

### Part 3: Create a Job Posting

1. **Navigate to Jobs Page**:
   - Click "Jobs" in sidebar/navigation

2. **Add New Job**:
   - Click "Add Job" or "Create Job"

### Part 4: Tailor Resume for Job (THE MAIN TEST!)

#### Prerequisites Check:
```bash
# Verify you have:
# ‚úÖ At least one PARSED resume (parsedData field exists)
# ‚úÖ At least one job with description (50+ characters)

     - "Finalizing..." (95%)
     - "Complete!" (100%)

4. **View Results**:
   Should see:

   **Match Score**:
   - Number between 0-100
   - Higher = better match
   - Example: "85% Match"

   **Changes Made**:
   - List of modifications
   - Each change shows:
     - Section (e.g., "Summary", "Experience")
     - Type (e.g., "Modified", "Added")

   - Example:
     ```
     Summary - Modified
     Enhanced summary to include job-specific keywords and highlight relevant experience

     Experience - Modified
     Added quantifiable achievements that match job requirements
     ```

   **Keyword Alignment**:
   - Matched Keywords: Skills you have that match job
     - Example: ["React", "TypeScript", "Node.js", "AWS"]
   - Missing Keywords: Skills from job you don't have
     - Example: ["GraphQL", "Kubernetes"]

   **Recommendations**:
   - List of actionable suggestions
   - Example:
     ```
     - Add more specific metrics to quantify achievements
     - Emphasize leadership experience relevant to this role
     - Consider taking a GraphQL course to fill skill gap
     ```

   **Tailored Resume Content**:
   - Full tailored resume
   - Can compare with original
   - Should see optimized wording
   - Keywords naturally integrated

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Resume must be parsed before tailoring"

**Cause**: Resume doesn't have parsed data

**Solution**:
1. Go to Resumes page
2. Find your resume
3. Click "Parse Resume"
4. Wait for parsing to complete (refresh page)
5. Verify resume shows "Parsed" status
6. Try tailoring again

### Issue 2: "Job description is too short or missing"

**Cause**: Job description is less than 50 characters

**Solution**:
1. Edit the job
2. Add a detailed job description (see example above)
3. Must be at least 50 characters
4. Include requirements and responsibilities
5. Save job
6. Try tailoring again

### Issue 3: AI Tailoring Times Out

**Symptoms**:
- Request takes longer than 60 seconds
- Browser shows timeout error

**Solutions**:
1. Check Claude API key is set:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY .env
   ```

2. Check Claude API quota:
   - Visit https://console.anthropic.com/
   - Check usage and limits

3. Check backend logs for errors:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   # Look for errors in output
   ```

4. Try with a shorter resume/job description

### Issue 4: Network Errors

**Error**: "Unable to connect to server"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify backend is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/health
   ```

2. Check frontend API URL:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   cat .env
   # Should show: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
   ```

3. Check for CORS errors in browser console

4. Restart both frontend and backend

### Issue 5: Authentication Errors

**Error**: "Not authorized" or 401/403 errors

**Solutions**:
1. Check you're logged in (see user name in top right)
2. Try logging out and back in
3. Clear browser cache/cookies
4. Check JWT token in browser DevTools:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application ‚Üí Local Storage
   - Look for "auth-storage"
   - Should have token and user data

### Issue 6: Mock Data Still Showing

**Cause**: Frontend not updated or cache issue

**Solutions**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify `aiService.ts` was updated:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/src/services
   head -20 aiService.ts
   # Should see "import { apiClient }" at top
   ```
4. Restart frontend dev server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
