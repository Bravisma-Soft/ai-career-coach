- [ ] No errors in deployment logs

## Testing

- [ ] Backend health check works: `curl https://backend.railway.app/api/health`
- [ ] Frontend loads successfully

- [ ] Resume upload works (tests S3)
- [ ] Resume parsing works (tests worker + AI)
- [ ] Job creation works
- [ ] Resume tailoring works
- [ ] Interview prep works
- [ ] All features tested end-to-end

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] CORS updated with final frontend domain
- [ ] Custom domains added (optional)
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS working (Railway does automatically)
- [ ] Error tracking set up (Sentry - optional)
- [ ] Monitoring set up (optional)
- [ ] Database backups verified

## Security Review

- [ ] All secrets are strong and unique
- [ ] No secrets committed to git
- [ ] S3 bucket is private
- [ ] CORS restricted to frontend domain only
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] HTTPS enforced

## Documentation

- [ ] Production URLs documented
- [ ] Access credentials stored securely
- [ ] Deployment process documented
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

## Environment Variables Template

### Generate Secrets
Run this command to generate secure secrets:

```bash
node -e "console.log('JWT_SECRET:', require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('JWT_REFRESH_SECRET:', require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
node -e "console.log('SESSION_SECRET:', require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
```

## Quick Commands Reference

### Test Backend Locally Before Deploying
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

### Test Frontend Locally Before Deploying
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Railway CLI Commands
```bash
# Install
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link project
railway link

# Run migrations
railway run npm run prisma:migrate:prod

# View logs
railway logs

# Run any command in production
railway run <command>
```

### Vercel CLI Commands
```bash
# Install
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
cd frontend
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

---

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Build Fails
```bash
# Test build locally first
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check DATABASE_URL
railway run env | grep DATABASE

# Test connection
railway run npx prisma db push
```

### CORS Errors
```bash
# Update CORS_ORIGIN in Railway backend variables
# Must include https:// protocol
# Example: https://myapp.vercel.app
```

### Worker Not Running
```bash
# Check worker logs in Railway
# Verify Redis connection
# Ensure all env vars copied to worker service
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Monitor for 24-48 hours
2. Check error rates and logs
3. Verify worker is processing jobs
4. Test under realistic load
5. Set up monitoring/alerts
6. Document any issues encountered
7. Create rollback plan if needed

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 2-4 hours (first time)

**Recommended Deployment Time**: During low-traffic hours or weekend

Good luck! ðŸš€
